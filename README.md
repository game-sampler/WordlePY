# WordlePY
Wordle in Python with extra features like variable word length and number of guesses.

Download both the .py file and words.txt to play. Most importantly, ensure that words.txt is in the same folder before playing.

Unlike the base game, you can use any N-character alphabetical string as your guess, where N is the length of the target word.
